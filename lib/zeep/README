= Zeep Mobile Messaging - SMS Made Easy.

With just a few lines of code, Zeep Mobile's API lets your web app communicate with your users over SMS. Zeep Mobile makes it easy to:

    * Manage your users' mobile content subscriptions
    * Send and receive SMS content 

These libraries take care of the HTTP Header signing and posting to the HTTP endpoint.

= Development

http://code.google.com/p/zeep-messaging/ is the home of this project. For read-only access to the subversion repo; this should sort you out:

$ svn checkout http://zeep-messaging.googlecode.com/svn/ruby/	trunk/ zeep-messaging-read-only  

= Installing zeep-messaging

Until we start publishing to rubyforge (coming soon) you'll have to get the latest gem from here:

http://code.google.com/p/zeep-messaging/downloads/list

Download it and then:

$ gem install zeep-messaging-0.1.X.gem

= Getting Started

* Head to http://zeepmobile.com/ and get a developer account. 
* Open your account page: https://secure.zeepmobile.com/account/
* Register a new application.
* Note your API_KEY and SECRET_KEY

	require 'rubygems' # Only required if you've installed the gem version
	require 'zeep/messaging'

	Zeep::Base.configure_credentials(<your api key>, <your secret key>)
	
	Zeep::send_message(<user_id>, "'Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?'")

Wasn't that easy?
